# aws-resource-manager

**PLEASE NOTE:** This tool stops/terminates cloud resources (that's its primary function). Therefore, use of this tool is not intended for production environments. Instead it's intended for development or personal environments where stopping/terminating cloud resources will have little impact. I accept no liability for any resources terminated that impact you or your business.

## Overview
A simple and extensible attempt at managing my AWS resources.

## Repository Design
This git repository is designed as a mono-repo and hence has all the components required to deploy and run an AWSResourceManager in your own account.
